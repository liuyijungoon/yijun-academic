I am a second-year master student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China. I am supervised by Prof. Zhengning Wang and my research interest is computer vision, especially Low-light image enhancement and environment perception.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree at UESTC in 2019.
